## Ray Tracer in Rust 

This is a ray tracer written in Rust. I wrote this as a Rust learning exercise in 2020 based on Peter Shirley's write-up found [here](https://raytracing.github.io/). I recently (Summer 2022) rewrote much of what I originally had. This project is still work in progress, but I'm really happy with the results so far.
