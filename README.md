## Description 

`ray-tracer` is a ray tracing algorithm written in Rust. I used this as a good project to try and learn some Rust fundamentals, and to mess around with a neat algorithm. I'm really happy with the result! I also know there's a lot of ways to improve the code here. Here are some images I rendered with this program:
